\section{Context}
Code completion, also often referred to as autocompletion, is one of the most used features in any IDE. Whether it is being used for improving speed and accuracy of typing, or is used as an API guide, helping developers find their way around native libraries, code completion is an essential part of any successful IDE and a fair share of code editors.

Code completion is basically used as a major productivity tool, and is one of the first things a developer notices as soon as they start coding. The speed with which the results are suggested, as well as their accuracy is very important, and it is something that can certainly "make or break" the workflow of the developer. Therefore, it is no wonder that improving code completion quality is also a somewhat popular research topic, where software engineers try to figure out a way to make code completion as effective, as accurate, and as fast as possible.

There are many approaches to handling the process of completing code. The classic strategies have been to use lexical models or to use semantic models. Lexical in this case essentially means completing words, or tokens, as they are called in source code, based on the prefix the user is typing, only relying on the text itself. Semantic models mean using code structure analysis to tailor completions (for instance, type or semantic role).

In the latest years statistical and machine learning (ML) models have also gained popularity. For the most part when using ML, source code analysis is also often disregarded, and the results of simply training the model on the code base and inferring all the possible code dependencies are used instead.

\section{Problem}
\label{sec:Introduction-Problem}
For example, in the last couple of years there has been a lot of work carried out to improve code completion quality in the Pharo IDE.

(Note: the name Pharo refers both to the dynamically-typed programming language that is a dialect of Smalltalk, as well as the interactive IDE where this language is used; from now on when referring to the language itself we will simply say \textit{Pharo}, whereas when referring to the IDE we will say \textit{the Pharo IDE}).

Among the approaches taken is replacing the old completion engine with an abstract syntax tree (AST) based one, that makes more use of the semantic information, and, more recently, adding a heuristics approach. However, there are more potential improvements from which developers can only benefit, such as improving the relevance of suggestions, which should also allow us to reduce the time and effort the developer spends to go through the list of completions.

As mentioned above, the current main implementation of code completion in the Pharo IDE is based on parsing and analysing AST information of source code, where we are able to determine the structure of the code, get the semantic role of tokens, as well as infer the type information where possible. The objective being to only suggest completions that are correct in the given context.

Therefore, once we have a list of semantically suitable completion candidates, they are sorted alphabetically. Unfortunately, this way the process of finding the desired completion candidate can be a bit cumbersome: the correct suggestions can be buried much lower than expected, which would prompt the developer to either scroll through the list, or to type even more characters, taking up valuable time and effort. Now, we believe this approach can be greatly improved by taking into account the relevance of suggestions, by analysing their use throughout source code history, and sorting the results based on that.

\section{Our Approach in a Nutshell}
\label{sec:Introduction-Approach}
Hence, in this work we intend to study how code completion can be improved using statistical language models for sorting the results, on top of an already existing semantic completion. In particular, the idea is to use the N-gram language model, as it has been documented to be used for such a task (\cite{Hind12a}). And specifically, we intend to implement it in the Pharo IDE and evaluate whether this approach indeed enhances the quality of code completion. In short, over the course of this work we intend to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can we improve code completion in the Pharo IDE by sorting candidate completions with an N-gram language model?
    \item Can we build a tool based on a trained N-gram model that would propose completion fast enough to be actually suitable for developer use?
    \item How can we best numerically evaluate the results of code completion produced by different completion strategies?
\end{itemize}

\section{Contributions}
The contributions of this work are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We develop and train N-gram (in particular, uni- (N=1) and bigram (N=2)) language models on the tokenised source code of a dynamically-typed programming language (Pharo)
    \item We implement the sorting functionality based on the results of the above-mentioned training in an open source IDE
    \item We test whether the combination of semantic-based completion and statistical-based sorting can indeed improve the performance of a code completion engine in an IDE and be effective enough to be used by real developers
    \item To our knowledge, this exact approach of separately considering these two parts is unique, and in addition nothing of the sort has been implemented in other Smalltalk-specific IDEs
\end{itemize}
