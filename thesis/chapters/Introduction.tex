\section{Context}
Code completion, also often referred to as autocompletion, is one of the most
used features in any IDE. Whether it is being used for improving speed and
accuracy of typing, or is used as an API guide, it is an essential part of any
successful IDE and a fair share of code editors. It is one of the first things
a developer notices as soon as they start coding, and it is something that can
certainly "make or break" the workflow. Therefore, it is no wonder that it is
also a somewhat popular research topic, where software engineers try to figure out
a way to make code completion as effective, as accurate, and as fast as possible.

There are many approaches to handling the process of completing code. The classic
strategies have been to use lexical models (completing based on the prefix the user
is typing) or to use semantic models (use code structure analysis information to
tailor completions). In the latest years statistical, or machine learning, models
have also gained popularity. For the most part when using ML, source code analysis
is also often disregarded in lieu of simply training the model on the code base and
inferring all the possible code dependencies from that.

\section{Problem}
\label{sec:Introduction-Problem}
In this work we are trying to give an answer to the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can we improve code completion in Pharo by sorting candidate completions
    with an n-gram language model?
    \item Can we build a tool based on a trained n-gram model that would propose
    completion fast enough to be used in an IDE?
    \item How can we numerically evaluate the results of code completion produced
    by different completion strategies?
\end{itemize}

\section{Our Approch}
\label{sec:Introduction-Approach}
Use N-gram models for sorting the results in Pharo code completion.
In particular, implement and have a working completion based on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item unigrams (frequencies)
    \item bigrams
\end{itemize}
