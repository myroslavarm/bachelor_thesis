In conclusion, the goal of the project has been reached: the completion in the Pharo IDE has indeed improved through using the N-gram language models for the task of sorting the results. However, contrary to the intuition, not only has the bigram approach performed worse than the unigram, it also doesn't seem to have performed better than even the alphabetic sorter. This yields more questions about the exact challenges of implementing this approach that haven't been met, and can be a good basis for future work in this topic.
