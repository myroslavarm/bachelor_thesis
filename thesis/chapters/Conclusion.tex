\insertion{In this work, we propose a machine learning-based technique for improving} the completion \insertion{engine} in the Pharo IDE \remove{has indeed improved} \remove{through} using the N-gram language models \replace{for the task of}{to} sort\remove{ing} the results. However, contrary to the intuition, \badstyle{not only has the bigram approach performed worse than the unigram, it also doesn't seem to have performed better than \remove{even} the alphabetic sorter}. \remove{This yields more questions about the exact challenges of implementing this approach that haven't been met, and can be a good basis for future work in this topic.}
