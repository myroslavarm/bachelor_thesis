\section{Earlier Code Completion Systems}
\label{sec:RelatedWorks-EarlierSystems}
Standard code completions in IDEs used to only rely on language-specific pattern matching, i.e. sorting completions alphabetically based on the symbols already typed in. \cite{Robb08a}, however, showed that code completion can be improved by using program history (program modifications over time). They managed to get good results by prioritising suggestions from recently modified method bodies, and even better results by using per-session vocabulary (changes of the last hour) and merging it with type-based completion.

According to \cite{Bruc09a}, up until 10 years ago code completion systems were exclusively based on type information, with no contextual analysis. The authors countered that by implementing intelligent code completions that learned from examples and had a significantly better performance in terms of relevance of suggestions than other (at the time) common implementations. Their solutions included the frequency based code completion (frequency of use of code), an association rule based completion, and the Best Matching Neighbours code completion (method calls of the closest source snippet found, using a modified k-nearest neighbours algorithm), which was the main contribution of their paper. The BMN based implementation was integrated into Eclipse and demonstrated promising results. It was later extended by \cite{Prok15a} (see \ref{sec:RelatedWorks-DeepLearning}).

\section{Software Naturalness}
\label{sec:RelatedWorks-SoftwareNaturalness}
In the paper "On The Naturalness of Software", \cite{Hind12a} compared source code to natural languages. They claim that code is even more repetitive, predictable and full of patterns than human languages. In the paper, they also argue that code can be modelled by statistical language models, which can be used to support software engineers. Their approach was based on capturing high-level statistical regularity at the n-gram level by taking n-1 previous tokens that are already entered into the text buffer, and attempting to guess the next token. Using this model, it is possible to estimate the most probable sequences of tokens and suggest the most relevant code completions to developers.

This work served as a catalyst for the following research using natural language processing (NLP) for source code. For instance, \cite{Tu14a} also learnt that code "has a high degree of localness, where identifiers (e.g. variable names) are repeated often within close distance" (\cite{Alla18a}). Thus, they applied a cache mechanism that assigns higher probability to tokens that have been observed most recently, and improved the results even further.

\cite{Nguy13a} enhanced the state-of-the-art n-gram approach by incorporating semantic information into code tokens, rather than treating them as text -- i.e. annotating each token with its data type and semantic role if available, which allowed them to increase predictability even further.

\section{Deep Learning for Code Completion}
\label{sec:RelatedWorks-DeepLearning}
In the more recent years, researchers started applying deep learning models such as deep recurrent neural networks (RNN).

For instance, \cite{Hell19a} recorded the results of a case study of 15,000 completions (completion events) for VisualStudio. One of the conclustions they reached is that even though RNNs often outperform n-gram models in typical natural language settings, n-gram models are sometimes a better choice for modeling source code. For example, the deep learner is better at core method invocations but loses on third-party library calls, whereas the n-gram model naturally outperforms it on internal API calls but loses out on the other categories.

\cite{Prok15a} worked on an extensible inference engine for intelligent code completion systems, called PatternBased Bayesian Network (PBN). Eclipse Code Recommenders project adapted the PBN approach for their intelligent call completion. They also tested (evaluating quality, speed and model size) Best Matching Neighbour algorithm, using additional context information for more precise recommendations, and applying clustering techniques to improve model sizes. They conclude that showing the developer hundreds of recommendations may be as ineffective as showing none, and intelligent code completions better target the needs of developers that are unfamiliar with an API.

\cite{Hell17a} introduced a dynamically updatable N-gram model which outperformed both the traditional N-gram models and the deep learning RNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) models.

\cite{Li17a} developed an attention mechanism which exploits the parent-children information of the AST of source code. As correctly predicting out-of-vocabulary (OoV) values in code completion is largely unsuccessful, the authors implemented a pointer mixture network which either generates a new value through an RNN component, or copies an OoV value from local context through a pointer component.

\cite{Rayc14a} implemented a tool called SLANG, which first extracts abstract histories from the data. Then, these histories are fed to a language model such as an n-gram model or recurrent neural network model, which treats the histories as sentences in a natural language and learns probabilities for each sentence, without taking into consideration the AST of the code.

\section{Existing Code Completion Systems in IDEs}
\label{sec:RelatedWorks-ExistingSystems}
The code completion system (Pythia) described by \cite{Svya19a} is part of the Intellicode extension used in the Visual Studio Code IDE to complete Python code. Pythia uses LSTM networks trained on long-range code contexts extracted from abstract syntax trees, which allows it to capture semantics carried by distant nodes and helps rank the method and API recommendations for developers more successfully. Python is a dynamically typed language, so to use type information in Pythia they infer types at runtime based on static analysis of user patterns and add this information into the training sequence.

\cite{Asad14a} developed a tool called CSCC (context-sensitive code completion) is an example-based completion tool which leverages contextual information to better support method call completion. CSCC uses tokenisation instead of deep parsing to collect method call usage patterns and requires type information of the receiver object. The CSCC tool is available as an Eclipse plugin for the Java Editor. Execution time wise the tool showed the results roughly equal to the state-of-the-art, but in terms of method call recommendation accuracy it outperformed those approaches, including BMN (the Best Matching Neighbours implementation from \cite{Bruc09a}).

CACHECA is a cache language model-based code completion tool for Eclipse's Java editor which was presented by \cite{Fran15a}; the tool is based on the cache language model described by \cite{Tu14a} and mentioned earlier in this chapter. According to \cite{Fran15a}, CACHECA greatly enhances Eclipse's built-in engine by incorporating both the corpus and locality statistics, especially when no type information is available.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:RelatedWorks-Summary}
Here is a brief overview of the progress made in the area of code completion research and development in recent years:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code completion tools used to only rely on language-specific pattern matching (i.e. by prefix), but around 10 years ago the idea of "intelligent" code completion that can learn from examples was popularised.
    \item The software engineering approaches following this idea relied on frequency of use of code, contextual association, and hierarchical proximity.
    \item From another perspective, source code was likened to natural languages because of its repetitiveness and patterns; the idea that source code can be modelled by statistical language models attracted more machine learning approaches for the task of improving code completion.
    \item Following that, a lot of code completion implementations using machine learning ignored such information as type and semantic meaning, and treated it as regular text, trying to infer relevant predictions from source code history alone.
    \item These days, code completion systems that are actually being used by developers (such as plugins for IDEs) mostly combine both the software engineering approach (taking advantage of semantic and contextual information) and the machine learning one (taking advantage of source code patterns).
\end{itemize}

Another thing worth noting is that the majority of the research experiments mentioned in this chapter have been tested on or applied for only statistically typed languages, predominantly Java and C\# (\cite{Hind12a} also trained on C).

The only related works in this chapter where the experiments included dynamically typed languages were: \cite{Robb08a} (Smalltalk, in addition to Java), \cite{Tu14a} (Python, in addition to Java), \cite{Li17a} (Javascript and Python), and \cite{Svya19a} (Python).
