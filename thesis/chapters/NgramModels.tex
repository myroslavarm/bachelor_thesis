\chapter{N-gram Models}
\label{chap:N-gram Models}

In this chapter we briefly go over the theoretical background for the N-grams
model, as well as describe in detail our approach and experiments with it.
\section{N-gram Language Models}
Language models are models that assign probabilities to sentences or
sequences of words (\cite{Jura09a}). One of the most widely used such models
is the N-gram model. It uses n-gram, which is a sequence of N words, most
commonly 2 (bigrams) or 3 (trigrams), as well as 1 (unigram).
