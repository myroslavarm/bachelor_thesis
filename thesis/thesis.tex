\begin{abstract}
\addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} % Add the abstract to the table of contents
Code completion is one of the essential features of any IDE that greatly improves the developer experience and productivity. Good code completion can both speed up the development process, as well as aid the developer in API exploration. On the other hand, having a slow or inaccurate completion can be very cumbersome. Thus, it is important to find a way to make is as effective as possible.

The current implementation of code completion in the Pharo IDE is based on the abstract syntax tree (AST) of source code. This allows us to know the semantic role and the type of tokens. Hence, at every point in the completion, only contextually relevant results are suggested. However, currently there is no effective way to sort the completion results.

In this work I study how code completion can be improved by sorting completion results using statistical language models, such as the n-gram language models. With the help of the n-gram approach, I implement two sorting strategies (unigram- and bigram-based) where the most relevant results are shown first.

Finally, I use the quantitative and qualitative evaluation techniques to compare the performance of the n-gram based to the alphabetic sorter, which is a default sorter in the Pharo IDE. As a result of the evaluation, the unigram sorter had the best performance.

As the final result, both the sorting strategies are available for usage in the Pharo IDE as part of the \href{https://github.com/myroslavarm/CompletionSorting}{CompletionSorting} library, although only the unigram is fast enough to be comfortably used by actual developers. The enhancement of the bigram sorter is part of the future work of this project.

\begin{acknowledgements}
\addchaptertocentry{\acknowledgementname} % Add the acknowledgements to the table of contents
I would like to express my endless gratitude to Oleksandr Zaitsev and Dr. Marcus Denker from the RMoD team at INRIA Lille for supervising this work, providing me with valuable feedback, and patiently answering my questions. I also want to thank Dr. Stéphane Ducasse for helping me arrange my internship at INRIA and my stay in Lille, as well as introducing me to Pharo during my first year of university and motivating me to participate in open source development and become a part of the Pharo community. I am also grateful to INRIA Lille and the European Smalltalk User Group (ESUG) for the opportunity and for financing this internship.

I would also like to thank Dr. Yuriy Tymchuk for helping me make my first steps in Pharo during Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2017, Julien Delplanque and Guillermo Polito from the RMoD team at INRIA Lille for giving me advice and assisting me throughout various stages of my work on code completion, Dr. Oles Hodych for providing me with recommendations for writing a thesis and various \LaTeX\  tips, as well as my mum and dad for supporting me throughout my Bachelor journey, my best friends Martin and Ryan for motivating me and keeping me grounded, and Conan O'Brien and Tina Fey for providing endless comedic relief when it was most needed -- such as writing this thesis in social isolation during the COVID-19 quarantine in a student room in Lille, France.

Finally, I want to thank the Ukrainian Catholic University and the Faculty of Applied Sciences for their continued support throughout my studies and this internship, particularly Oles Dobosevych and Dr. Yaroslav Prytula for their patience, kindness, and belief in me. It has really been an honour to be a part of this program.
