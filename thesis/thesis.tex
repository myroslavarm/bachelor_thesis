\begin{abstract}
\addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} % Add the abstract to the table of contents
Code completion is one of the essential features of any IDE that greatly improves the developer experience and productivity. Good code completion can both speed up the development process, as well as aid the developer in API exploration. On the other hand, having a slow or inaccurate completion can be very cumbersome. Thus, \repetition{it} is important to find a way to make \repetition{it} as effective as possible.

The current implementation of code completion in the Pharo IDE is based on the abstract syntax tree (AST) of source code. This allows us to know the semantic role and the type of tokens. Hence, at every point in the completion, contextually relevant results \badstyle{are suggested}.

However, the completion candidates that \badstyle{are proposed are sorted} alphabetically. \notclear{This approach ignores the potential of suggesting more relevant completion results based on their occurence in code history, which is something that has been successfully adopted by other IDEs.}

In this work we study how code completion can be improved by sorting completion results using statistical language models. In particular, for our experiment we chose the n-gram language model. With the help of the n-gram \badstyle{implementation, we implement} a sorting strategy where the \repetition{most relevant results are shown first}. This allows us to propose \repetition{more accurate suggestions} even when we don't know the exact type of the token, and \repetition{makes finding a desired suggestion much faster}.

Finally, we evaluate the \notclear{various sorting strategies} to measure how effective they are in practice.

\oz{A few more words about evaluation: What did you evaluate? (e.g. "we evaluated strategy A by comparing it to strategy B") How did you evaluate? (e.g. "we measured precision expressed as... probability that the correct completion will be in top 5?") What was the result of evaluation? (e.g. "strategy A proposed by us in this paper has precision 90\% while strategy B has only 40\%")}

\oz{And about your contribution: part of your work was already accepted as a pull request to Pharo 9, the rest of it (latest updates to code completion) you have submitted to be reviewed by the community}

I would like to express my endless gratitude to Oleksandr Zaitsev and Dr. Marcus Denker from the RMoD team at INRIA Lille for supervising this work, providing me with valuable feedback, and patiently answering my questions. I also want to thank Dr. Stéphane Ducasse for helping me arrange my internship at INRIA and my stay in Lille, as well as introducing me to Pharo during my first year of university and motivating me to participate in open source development and become a part of the Pharo community. I am also grateful to INRIA Lille and the European Smalltalk User Group (ESUG) for the opportunity and for financing this internship.

I would also like to thank Yuriy Tymchuk for helping me make my first steps in Pharo during Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2017, Julien Delplanque and Guillermo Polito from the RMoD team at INRIA Lille for giving me advice and assisting me throughout various stages of my work on code completion, Oles Hodych for providing me with recommendations for writing a thesis and various \LaTeX\  tips, as well as my mum and dad for supporting me throughout my Bachelor journey, my best friends Martin and Ryan for motivating me and keeping me grounded, and Conan O'Brien and Tina Fey for providing endless comedic relief when it was most needed -- such as writing this thesis in social isolation during the COVID-19 quarantine in a student room in Lille, France.

Finally, I want to thank the Ukrainian Catholic University and the Faculty of Applied Sciences for their continued support throughout my studies and this internship, particularly Oles Dobosevych and Dr. Yaroslav Prytula for their patience, kindness, and belief in me. It has really been an honour to be a part of this program.
