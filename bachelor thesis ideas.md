#### main idea:

In this work, I study how machine learning and statistical language models can be used to improve code completion in Pharo.



The previous section discussed the problem of words whose bigram probability is
zero. But what about words we simply have never seen before?
Sometimes we have a language task in which this can’t happen because we know
all the words that can occur : **different in code**

in general the idea is to define all the questions and assumptions/hypotheses and work based on that (the answers to questions can basically morph into whole sections)



oleks as supervisor? marcus? oles? can be more than one supervisor?

who's the examiner? stef? oles? how many examiners? combine supervisor/examiner?



#### stages of thesis project:

1. project proposal (a few pages long re on what i intend to do) - what i CAN do
   1. subject area - topic and scope -- **start early !!!**
   2. aim - goal of project
   3. arguments - why this topic is important
   4. objectives - preliminary ideas how you intend to achieve aim
   5. time estimation (cut some slack)
2. more extensive problem description - researching materials, aim and objectives
3. doing the actual work, collecting+analysing data, drawing conclusions from results
4. first draft, update
